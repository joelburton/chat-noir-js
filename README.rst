Chat Noir
=========

A JS implementation of a graph-based game.

In this game, the cat (the red dot) is trying to escape to freedom. You can
try to stop it by clicking on a cell to block that cell (blocked cells
are then impassable to the cat). Every time you move, the cat then
uses an AI to determine it's shortest path and it takes one step toward
freedom.

Can you stop the cat in time?
